My name is Aishraj Dahal. I am full stack developer from Nepal, living in Bangalore, India.

I've been programming computers since I was a twelve year old and still do it for fun and for a living.

I believe that technology could be used for the greater good of people and strive hard to build *human friendly software*.

Besides being a programmer, I'm a voracious reader and an avid travller and a foodie.
