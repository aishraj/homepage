My name is Aishraj Dahal. I am full stack developer and a distributed systems nerd.

I've been hacking around computers since I was twelve and still do it for fun and for a living.

Whenever I'm not glued to my computer hacking on something interesting, I read, travel and write.

In case you'd like to litter my inbox,  send me an email at [first four letters of my name]@[domain].com.
