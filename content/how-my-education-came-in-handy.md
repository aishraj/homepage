The rough idea is to create a series of blog posts about case studies where something that I learnt in college came in handy when working on an industry project.
Off the top of my head here are some case studies
- Programming lanuages came in handy when we were working on the ERE at PD.
- DBMS comes in handy every day. Give an example here. Off the top of my head the HackerRank jobs stuff is something that I can use.
- Operating Systerms and how those concepts came in handy when debugging systems performance. I can give an example here about monitoring load and latency numbers at PD
- Data Structures and Algorithms - used every day but give an example of a time when this was useful
