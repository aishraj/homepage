```
//Brain dump
- how while we were young people fixated on "scope"
- how in the grand scheme of things, it is important to create that scope rather than join
- write about how inventing a new scope or a new market is challenging but has a lasting impact
- so for programmers it means, when you're young, go try out building stuff that nobody may use beside you. buidl things because they are fun to build, not because a corporation will pay you a hefty salary for it. if you are good at your craft, corporations will pay. Because guess what a large number of people do not find it fun to build things, and if you can it will be worth it.
