At times, people look at me with bizarre bewilderment when I say that I had a great time hacking a side project on a weekend. For someone not in the creative world, doing something that is done for their day job without getting paid seems like a crazy idea. Paul Graham, in his now famous essay, [_Hackers and Painters_](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html) talks about how hackers, like painters and composers, are “makers”. Most “makers”, unlike administrators attain perfection by performing gradual refinement of their work. Just as a composer composing a melody draws joy by changing a few notes to make the melody better, hackers derive happiness by building hardware/software that simplifies human life. Perhaps, it is this joy of building something useful, that motivates hackers to hack a solution, even if it means doing this in their “own time.
