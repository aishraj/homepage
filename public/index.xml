      <description>“Whatever grows will grow, Whatever dies will die Whatever works will work Whatever flies will fly, Whatever fails will fail What’s meant to soar will soar, I am planting seeds nothing more” As the crowd started to sing along the chorus, the singer, a Wharton educated young man who gave up a career on Wall Street to find his purpose in serving others slowly waved back and sang along.

      <description>My name is Aishraj Dahal. I am full stack developer from Nepal, living in Bangalore, India. I&amp;rsquo;ve been programming computers since I was a twelve year old and still do it for fun and for a living. I believe that technology could be used for the greater good of people and strive hard to build human friendly software. Besides being a programmer, I&amp;rsquo;m a voracious reader and an avid travller and a foodie.</description>
